```{r setup}
library(readxl)

df <- read_excel("Book2.xlsx", range = "b6:C21")

df_before = c(df$`boxes per day before`)
df_after = c(df$`boxes per day afer`)
mean_before = mean(df_before)
```

## assumption
H0: productivity has no change in before/after.  
H1: productivity has changed before/after.  
Significant level: 5%

```{r}
t.test(
  df_before,
  df_after,
  paired = T
)
```
Paired T test shows H0 is true.  
P value (0.1139) is greater than 5%.  H0 is not rejected.  

It means short breaks have no impact to productivity.
